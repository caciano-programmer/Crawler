This web crawler crawls web pages searching for links that contain a keyword(provided by user) and then displays 
all the links that match the search. The user also has the ability to choose how long the interface searches for results.
The main point for this project was to learn about threads in java while building something. Download the jar to use this app, note
for windows OS only.
